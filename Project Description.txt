This website will aim to provide users a space to practice mindfullness. This includes places for journaling,
a space for venting that will be wiped daily, reminders, notes, and some breathing and relaxation techniques.
Something similar to headspace. I might also throw in a budget feature if I can't find enough ideas that involve
a good amount of code or I run out of ideas.
